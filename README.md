## Introduction

This project implements **Real-Time Object Analysis** using Python and Machine Learning. It is designed to identify objects in real-time using a machine learning model. The primary use case demonstrated is detecting whether a person is wearing a helmet or not, but it can be adapted for other real-time object detection tasks.

## Features
- Detect objects in real-time using a webcam feed.
- Identify if a person is wearing a helmet or not.
- Use pre-trained machine learning models for quick object detection.
- Customizable for detecting other types of objects.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for this project.
- **OpenCV**: To capture and process real-time video feed.

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Real-Time-Object-Analysis-with-Py-and-ML.git
   cd Real-Time-Object-Analysis-with-Py-and-ML
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the pre-trained model:**
   - You can use an existing model from a repository like [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) or train your own model (instructions below).

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can run the object analysis by executing the following command:

```bash
object_detection.py
```

This script will open a webcam feed and start analyzing objects in real-time.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the helmet detection model can be any labeled dataset containing images of people with and without helmets. You can source such datasets from:
- Kaggle
- Custom images scraped from the web
- Your own curated dataset

## Model Training

To train your own model:
1. Prepare your dataset and ensure that it's split into training and testing sets.
2. Modify the `model.caffemodel` script with the appropriate dataset paths.
3. Run the model training script:
   ```bash
   model.caffemodel
   ```
4. Once the model is trained, save the model file (e.g., `model.h5`) and use it in the real-time detection script.

## Real-Time Object Detection

The real-time object detection is powered by OpenCV to process the webcam feed, and TensorFlow or another ML framework to analyze each frame and detect objects.

To run the object detection, ensure you have a working webcam connected to your system, and run:

```bash
object_detection.py
```

## Future Enhancements
- Expand object detection capabilities to multiple types of objects (e.g., cars, animals, etc.).
- Implement a web-based interface for real-time monitoring.
- Improve the modelâ€™s accuracy by training with larger datasets.
- Explore integration with edge devices for faster real-time analysis.
